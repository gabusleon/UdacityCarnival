# Udacity Carnival
Starter project for the Udacity [VR Developer Nanodegree](http://udacity.com/vr) program.

- Course: Introduction to Virtual Reality
- Project: Udacity Carnival

# About
This project was built by Gabriel A. LeÃ³n Paredes. The goal of this project is to modify the original Udacity Carnival VR project to interact with the Unity game framework. This project has been built using 2017.4.21f1 Unity version (oculus recommended version). I have used this Unity version because I am developing apps for Oculus Rift hardware. 

Also, to meet with the specifications of the Udacity Carnival Project, I have (1) personalized the Scoreboard title with "Gabriel A. Leon Paredes Scores". I have changed the font size to 1.7 in order to fit into the text input box. Also, I have (2) customized the Coin Toss Game so that the coin could be toss. To accomplish this specification I have changed the Min and Max toss power of the Carnival Coin Toss component. I have changed to 10 (min) and 13 (max) values. These values have been obtained from the secret code "CTMin10Max13". Then, I have (3) customized the wheel of fortune game to display different values of the wedges. I have used 75, 100, 150, 200 values for smaller to larger wedges correspondingly. Additionally, I have (4) customize the Plinko game in order to start falling the ball in different positions. I have used an oscillation distance value of 0.7. This value has been obtained when successfully toss a coin in the Toss Coin game. The value presented is "OssDist0.7". Finally, I have (5) changed the position of the Teddy Bear in order to land near to the wheel of fortune game and not under the player.
